This is my first post and its here just to test everything and confirm that everything is working fine.

Since this is a tech blog, nothing better for a test than running a "Hello, world!" program. So, I leave below the implementation of this program in the languages with I'm currently working these days.

**Hello, world! em Java**
```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

**Hello, world! em Javascript**
```javascript
alert('Hello, world!');
```

**Hello, world! em PHP**
```php
<?php
    echo 'Hello, world!';
?>
```

**Hello, world! em Python**
```python
print "Hello, world!"
```
That's it for now! See you!
