My name is James, I'm a Brazilian software developer working with IT since 2009. I hold a BS in Computer Science and an MSc in Software Engineering from UNESP, in SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD at IMT Atlantique in Nantes - France, researching the use of Machine Learning techniques applied to Model Views in the context of Model-Driven Engineering.
I consider myself a tech generalist, so my interests range from trivial programming problems to the unavoidable breakthroughs in the tech landscape brought by AI in the last few years.

I like to write about all technology subjects, so this space serves to spread, as far as possible, what I write about, contributing in some way to my knowledge.

In addition to technology, I love talking, reading, and writing about pop culture, especially comics and sci-fi. There may also be some texts in this space about these topics, although this is not the main focus.

Welcome to my world. :)
